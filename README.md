# Titanic Survival Prediction

Predict survival on the Titanic using machine learning models and feature engineering.

## Overview
- Binary classification: survive (`1`) vs not survive (`0`)
- Explored feature engineering and model evaluation
- Compared baseline and tuned models

## Dataset
- Kaggle Titanic dataset — Passenger demographics and voyage details

## Methods
- Data cleaning & feature engineering
- Models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.
- Evaluation with accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrices
